# cognizant
I spend a lot of time in front of a screen. I wanted to make a simple cli with a mindfulness bell to remember to take a breath and perhaps give your eyes a rest.

# Installation
```bash
npm install cognizant --global
```

# Usage
```bash
cognizant (defaults to ring every 20 minutes)
```
```bash
cognizant -n 30
```
```bash
cognizant --help
```
